At NearCare, we empower both individuals and charities to turn compassion into action. Because that is how change happens.

          With fundraising for all, we are creating the giving layer of the internet: a space where individuals, teams, organisations, and nonprofits can champion causes that matter and raise money to make a lasting difference. Through NearCare, people and organisations have the tools they need to share their cause far and wide and harness the power of generosity. We are transforming the way people give and changing livesâ€”are you ready to join us?"
